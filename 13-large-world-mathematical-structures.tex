\subsection{Monoids and Homomorphisms}
Suppose some function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ and $f(n)=n$. This function
$f$ respects addition in the following sense.
\begin{align*}
    f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)
\end{align*}
We can add $m+n$ first and then map it via $f$, or we can first map $m, n$ via
$f$, and then add them.

\begin{ttta}
Another possible function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is given by
$f(n) = 2n$. See if you can check that this also satisfies the above condition
$f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$.
\begin{align*}
    f(m+n) =& f(m) + f(n)\\
    2(m+n) =& 2(m) + 2(n)\\
    2(m+n) =& 2(m+n)\\
    m+n =& m+n
\end{align*}
Thus we have shown that $f$ respects addition.
\end{ttta}

\begin{ttta}
Show that this function
\[
f=\set{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, -1), (3, 2), (4, -2), (5, 3), (6, -3), \dots}
\]
does not respect addition.
\begin{align*}
    f(1+3) =& f(1) + f(3)\\
    f(4) =& f(1) + f(3)\\
    -2 =& 1 + 2\\
    -2 \neq& 3
\end{align*}
\end{ttta}

\begin{ttta}
Mapping into the integers is special because it turns out that respecting
addition forces a function to respect the identity. Prove it.
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item To respect addition a function $f$ must satisfy the following equation $f(m+n) =
f(m)+f(n)$.  Let us suppose that $f$ does respect addition and show that it
implies that $f$ also respects the identity.
\begin{align*}
    f(0+n) =& f(0) + f(n)\\
    f(n) =& f(0) + f(n)\\
    f(0) =& 0
\end{align*}
\end{proofitem}
\begin{definition}
Let $A$ and $B$ be monoids, and write the identity as $1$ and the
binary operation as $\circ$ in each case. Then a monoid homomorphism from A to
B is a function $f:A\rightarrow B$ on the underlying sets, such that
\begin{align*}
    \forall x, y \in A, f(x \circ y) &= f(x) \circ f(y)&&f\text{ respects }\circ\\
    f(1)&=1&&f\text{ respects identity}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\stepcounter{tttacounter}
\begin{ttta}
What do we need to check to show that monoids and their homomorphisms form a
category?
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item Let $M$ be the set of monoids, $M_A, M_B, M_C, \ldots, \in M$.
\item Let $\mathcal{C}_\text{mon}$ be a category where each object is a monoid
    $A\in M$, and each arrow $\times$ is a mapping $A,B \in M, \times:
    A\rightarrow B$.
\item Let $f, g$ be composable functions, ie they are arrows between objects.
\item Let $\circ$ be a binary composition operation on arrows.
\item Let $\ast$ be a binary composition operation on monoidal elements.
\item To show that monoids and their homomorphisms form a cateogry we must show
    the properties of unitality and associativity.
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{align}
    (g\circ f)(x\ast y) &= g(f(x\ast y)) && \text{def. of }\circ\\
    &= g(f(x) \ast f(y)) && f\text{ respects }\ast\\
    &= g(f(x)) \ast g(f(y)) && g\text{ respects }\ast\\
    &= (g\circ f)(x) \ast (g\circ f)(y) && \text{def. of }\circ\\
    (g\circ f)(1)&= g(f(1)) && \text{def. of }\circ\\
    &= g(1) && f \text{ respects }1\\
    &= 1 && g \text{ respects }1
\end{align}
\end{proofitem}

\subsection{Groups}
\begin{ttta}
Define group homomorphism as a function respecting the group structure. When
dealing with groups, it is redundant to ask for the identity to be preserved.
Itâ€™s also redundant to ask for the inverses to be preserved. Prove this.
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item The properties needed for a group are identity, inverse, and
    associativity. We can show that if there exists a function $f$ which is a
    group homomorphism, then we get inverse and identity for freebeez.
\item Suppose $f: G \rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$. Then:
\begin{align*}
    f(x\ast x^{-1}) &= f(1_G)\\
    f(x)\ast f(x^{-1}) &= 1_H
\end{align*}
\item Therefore $f(x^{-1})$ is indeed the inverse of $f(x)$ and inverse is
    preserved.
\begin{align*}
    f(x\ast 1_G) &= f(x)\\
    f(x)\ast f(1_G) &= f(x)\\
    f(x^{-1})\ast f(x)\ast 1_H &= f(x^{-1})\ast f(x)\\
    1_H &= f(x^{-1}\ast x)\\
    1_H &= f(1_G)
\end{align*}
\item Therefore identity is preserved.
\end{proofitem}

\begin{ttta}
Do we have to check anything else to show that groups and group homomorphisms form a category?
\end{ttta}
Because groups are monoids with an extra property, there is nothing to check
because monoids already form a cateogry. In other words, the monoidal nature of
a group is sufficient to show unitality and associativity for a category created
from some set that is also a group.

\subsection{Posets}
\begin{ttta}
Create a definition of an order-preserving function for posets in general by
analogy with the structure-preserving maps we've seen already.
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item Let $f:P\rightarrow Q$ be some function between two posets $P$ and $Q$.
    Because $P$ and $Q$ are posets, we know that individually they both have the
    properties reflexivity, transitivity, and antisymmetry. For $f$ to be order
    preserving, the only condition on $f$ is
\begin{align*}
    x\geq_P y \implies f(x)\geq_Q f(y)
\end{align*}
\end{proofitem}

\begin{ttta}
Do we have to check anything to show that we have a category of posets and order-preserving functions?
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
    \item To check that we have a category, we must assure unitality and
        associativity are preserved.
\end{proofitem}
\begin{align*}
    x \geq y &\implies f(x) \geq f(y) \\
             &\implies g(f(x) \geq g(f(y)) \\
             &\implies (g\circ f)(x) \geq (g\circ f)(y) \\
\end{align*}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
\input{poset}
\end{center}
\caption{Poset Category $\mathbf{Poset}$}
\end{figure}

\begin{ttta}
Think again about the poset of factors of 42.
Observe that $6 < 7$ but 6 is higher than 7 in this diagram. What two orderings
are we considering on the same set of numbers here, and what map is it that is
not order-preserving?
\end{ttta}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
        \input{42-factor}
    \end{center}
    \caption{42-factor lattice}
\end{figure}
\begin{proofitem}
\item Let $S=\set{1,2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42}\subset \mathbb{N}$.
\item One order is $\geq$ as defined on $\mathbb{N}$.
    The other order is divides $\mid$, as in $a\mid b$---for example $6\mid 12$.
    Both orders are reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive, as required by
    definition.
\item Let us consider the map $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$, where $f=+1$.
    For the ordering $\geq$, $f$ preserves ordering.
\begin{align*}
    f(x \geq y) =& f(x) \geq f(y)\\
        =& x+1 \geq y+1\\
        =& x \geq y
\end{align*}
Now we will show that $f$ does not preserve ordering on $\mid$ by
counter-example.
\begin{align*}
    f(x \mid y) =& f(x) \mid f(y)&&\text{Let }x=7, y=14\\
    f(7 \mid 14) =& f(7) \mid f(14)\\
     \neq& 8 \mid 15
\end{align*}
Thus we have shown that $\mid$ does not preserve ordering.
\end{proofitem}

\subsection{Categories}
\begin{ttta}
Think of a sensible starting point for a definition of a morphism of
categories $F: \mathbb{C} \longrightarrow \mathbb{D}$. It should map objects to
objects and arrows to arrows, but if we start with an arrow $x \xrightarrow{f}
y\in\mathbb{C}$ what should the source and target of $F(f)$ be in
$\mathbb{D}$?
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
    \item
    \begin{align*}
        f\in \mathbb{C}&: x \rightarrow y\\
        F(f)\in \mathbb{D}&: F(x) \rightarrow F(y)
    \end{align*}
\end{proofitem}

\begin{ttta}
Come up with the definition of a morphism between categories, starting
with the action of $F$ on objects and arrows. Then proceeding by making
sure it is structure-preserving. To do this, you need to be clear what the
structure of a category is: identities and composition. Once you've done this,
can you check that this gives us a category of small categories and all
morphisms between them.
\end{ttta}
