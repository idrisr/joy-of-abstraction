\subsection{Monoids and Homomorphisms}
Suppose some function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ and $f(n)=n$. This function
$f$ respects addition in the following sense.
\begin{align*}
    f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)
\end{align*}
We can add $m+n$ first and then map it via $f$, or we can first map $m, n$ via
$f$, and then add them.

\begin{ttta}
Another possible function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ is given by
$f(n) = 2n$. See if you can check that this also satisfies the above condition
$f(m+n) = f(m) + f(n)$.
\begin{align*}
    f(m+n) =& f(m) + f(n)\\
    2(m+n) =& 2(m) + 2(n)\\
    2(m+n) =& 2(m+n)\\
    m+n =& m+n
\end{align*}
Thus we have shown that $f$ respects addition.
\end{ttta}

\begin{ttta}
Show that this function
\[
f=\set{(0, 0), (1, 1), (2, -1), (3, 2), (4, -2), (5, 3), (6, -3), \dots}
\]
does not respect addition.
\begin{align*}
    f(1+3) =& f(1) + f(3)\\
    f(4) =& f(1) + f(3)\\
    -2 =& 1 + 2\\
    -2 \neq& 3
\end{align*}
\end{ttta}

\begin{ttta}
Mapping into the integers is special because it turns out that respecting
addition forces a function to respect the identity. Prove it.
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item To respect addition a function $f$ must satisfy the following equation $f(m+n) =
f(m)+f(n)$.  Let us suppose that $f$ does respect addition and show that it
implies that $f$ also respects the identity.
\begin{align*}
    f(0+n) =& f(0) + f(n)\\
    f(n) =& f(0) + f(n)\\
    f(0) =& 0
\end{align*}
\end{proofitem}
\begin{definition}
Let $A$ and $B$ be monoids, and write the identity as $1$ and the
binary operation as $\circ$ in each case. Then a monoid homomorphism from A to
B is a function $f:A\rightarrow B$ on the underlying sets, such that
\begin{align*}
    \forall x, y \in A, f(x \circ y) &= f(x) \circ f(y)&&f\text{ respects }\circ\\
    f(1)&=1&&f\text{ respects identity}
\end{align*}
\end{definition}

\begin{ttta}
What do we need to check to show that monoids and their homomorphisms form a
category?
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item Let $M$ be the set of monoids, $M_A, M_B, M_C, \ldots, \in M$.
\item Let $\mathcal{C}_\text{mon}$ be a category where each object is a monoid
    $A\in M$, and each arrow $\times$ is a mapping $A,B \in M, \times:
    A\rightarrow B$.
\item Let $f, g$ be composable functions, ie they are arrows between objects.
\item Let $\circ$ be a binary composition operation on arrows.
\item Let $\ast$ be a binary composition operation on monoidal elements.
\item To show that monoids and their homomorphisms form a cateogry we must show
    the properties of unitality and associativity.
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\begin{align}
    (g\circ f)(x\ast y) &= g(f(x\ast y)) && \text{def. of }\circ\\
    &= g(f(x) \ast f(y)) && f\text{ respects }\ast\\
    &= g(f(x)) \ast g(f(y)) && g\text{ respects }\ast\\
    &= (g\circ f)(x) \ast (g\circ f)(y) && \text{def. of }\circ\\
    (g\circ f)(1)&= g(f(1)) && \text{def. of }\circ\\
    &= g(1) && f \text{ respects }1\\
    &= 1 && g \text{ respects }1
\end{align}
\end{proofitem}
\input{monoid}
\begin{ttta}
Define group homomorphism as a function respecting the group structure. When
dealing with groups, it is redundant to ask for the identity to be preserved.
Itâ€™s also redundant to ask for the inverses to be preserved. Prove this.
\end{ttta}
\begin{proofitem}
\item The properties needed for a group are identity, inverse, and
    associativity. We can show that if there exists a function $f$ which is a
    group homomorphism, then we get inverse and identity for freebeez.
\item Suppose $f: G \rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$. Then:
\begin{align*}
    f(x\ast x^{-1}) &= f(1_G)\\
    f(x)\ast f(x^{-1}) &= 1_H
\end{align*}
\item Therefore $f(x^{-1})$ is indeed the inverse of $f(x)$ and inverse is
    preserved.
\begin{align*}
    f(x\ast 1_G) &= f(x)\\
    f(x)\ast f(1_G) &= f(x)\\
    f(x^{-1})\ast f(x)\ast 1_H &= f(x^{-1})\ast f(x)\\
    1_H &= f(x\ast x^{-1})\\
    1_H &= f(1_G)
\end{align*}
\item Therefore identity is preserved.
\end{proofitem}
